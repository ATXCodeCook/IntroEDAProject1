Introduction to EDA using Pandas for Data Analyst degree

Note: Github has issues with displaying .ipynb tables that have the "${:,.2f}" formatting. 
An extra quote is placed before the $ causing the table cell to break. Solution given is to 
view the notebook with jupyter.org nbviewer. A link file has been created in the repo but is
also available below.
